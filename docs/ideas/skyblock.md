# Skyblock-Related


## Mentions

- jsorrell's [Carpet Sky Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet-sky-additions)
- BPR02's [Sky Void Additions](https://modrinth.com/datapack/sky-void-additions)

Both of these take on the spirit of carpet mods where any new additions are purely based on mechanics.
I.e. no new blocks, items, or entities.

I eventually want to get good enough to implement the ideas below into my own skyblock additions :)


## No Reliance on Biome-Islands or Wandering Traders

I think wandering trader is simply not a good design for skyblocks.  
They don't need to change, but most, if not all, trader-exclusive items should also be available via other methods.

### Moss

Flowing water facing mud can convert mud into moss based on random tick
if the flowing water is connected to a source block that is cardinally adjacent to a grass block.  
If the mud and at least one of the grass blocks are in pale oak forest biome, the moss will convert into pale moss instead.

### Pointed Dripstone

Water above dripstone block in dripstone cave biome can generate poitned dripstone below the dripstone block.

### Saplings

Sniffers can sniff saplings out of rooted dirts.  
The saplings available will be based on the distribution of tree types in said biome.

### Seeds

Farmer has wheat seed, pumpkin seed, beetroot seed, and melon seed in its gifting loot pool.

### Mycelium, Red/Brown Mushrooms

Grass block in mushroom fields biome struck by lightning converts to mycelium.

### Sugar Cane

### Cactus

### Kelp

Sniffers can sniff kelp out of rooted dirts below sea level in any ocean biomes they naturally generate in.

### Corals

### Sea Pickle

Bone mealing a living coral block with water source on top in any ocean biomes they naturally generate in
has a chance of generating sea pickle if the water is below sea level.

### Pale Hanging Moss

Grown pale oaks in pale oak forest also generate pale hanging moss.
