# Skyblock-Related


## Mentions

- jsorrell's [Carpet Sky Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet-sky-additions)
- BPR02's [Sky Void Additions](https://modrinth.com/datapack/sky-void-additions)

Both of these take on the spirit of carpet mods where any new additions are purely based on mechanics.
I.e. no new blocks, items, or entities.

I eventually want to get good enough to implement the ideas below into my own skyblock additions :)


## No Reliance on Biome-Islands or Wandering Traders

I think wandering trader is simply not a good design for skyblocks.  
They don't need to change, but most, if not all, trader-exclusive items should also be available via other methods.

### Moss

Flowing water facing mud can convert mud into moss based on random tick
if the flowing water is connected to a source block that is cardinally adjacent to a grass block.  
If the mud and at least one of the grass blocks are in pale oak forest biome, the moss will convert into pale moss instead.

### Pointed Dripstone

Water above dripstone block in dripstone cave biome can generate poitned dripstone below the dripstone block.

### Saplings

Sniffers can sniff saplings out of rooted dirts.  
The saplings available will be based on the distribution of tree types in said biome.

### Seeds

Farmer has wheat seed, pumpkin seed, beetroot seed, and melon seed in its gifting loot pool.

### Mycelium, Red/Brown Mushrooms

Grass block in mushroom fields biome struck by lightning converts to mycelium.

### Sugar Cane

### Cactus

### Kelp

Sniffers can sniff kelp out of rooted dirts below sea level in any ocean biomes they naturally generate in.

### Corals

### Sea Pickle

Bone mealing a living coral block with water source on top in any ocean biomes they naturally generate in
has a chance of generating sea pickle if the water is below sea level.

### Pale Hanging Moss

Grown pale oaks in pale oak forest also generate pale hanging moss.


## Less Reliance on Time or Randomness

### Locating Structures and Biomes

The goal here is to ideally completely eliminate the reliance on chunkbase.

#### Expanded Cartographer

Cartographer has a lot more maps to choose from in the map trades,
and the probabilities can be influenced by some constellation of blocks around him
at the time the trade is created (e.g. like bookshelf constellation around enchanting table)?

So we could have a cartographer hall along side librarian hall, for example XD

### More Controlled Librarian

Could also use blocks constellation to influence possible enchantments? For example:

- Anvil and respawn anchor increase chance of getting mending,
with more charged respawn anchor having more impact.
- Concuit increases chance of getting aqua affinity, respiration, depth strider, loyalty, channeling, riptide, and impaling.
with more conduit power having more impact.
- Claimed barrels (fishermen) increase chance of getting lure, luck of the sea, and frost walker.
- Claimed blast furnaces (armourers) increase chance of getting thorns and all protections.
- Claimed cartography tables (cartographers) increase chance of getting unbreaking and feather falling.
- Claimed fletching tables (fletchers) increase chance of getting power, flame, infinity, punch, quick charge, multishot, and piercing.
- Claimed smithing tables (toolsmiths) increase chance of getting efficiency, fortune, and silk touch.
- Claimed grindstones (weaponsmiths) increase chance of getting sharpness, bane of arthropods, smite, breach, density, knockback, fire aspect, sweeping edge, and looting.
- Something bad luck related for the curses.

With these claimed job sites constellation, I'm imagining a replacement to the traditional pathfinding-isolated lectern-breaking room with an array of villagers and job blocks constellation (possibly on a piston feedtape).

To de-cheese getting all the enchantments if that's too easy, albeit repetitive, the chances could also be reduced to 0 entirely so these contellations become a necessity instead.
