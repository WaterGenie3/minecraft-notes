# Time and Randomness

The overall goal is to reduce the reliance on time and randomness factors in various mechanics.  
Time and randomness can still be there, but these factors should be mitigatable in some way.

## Locating Structures and Biomes

The goal here is to ideally completely eliminate the reliance on chunkbase.

### Expanded Cartographer

Cartographer has a lot more maps to choose from in the map trades,
and the probabilities can be influenced by some constellation of blocks around him
at the time the trade is created (e.g. like bookshelf constellation around enchanting table)?

So we could have a cartographer hall along side librarian hall, for example XD

## More Controlled Librarian

Could also use blocks constellation to influence possible enchantments? For example:

- Anvil and respawn anchor increase chance of getting mending,
with more charged respawn anchor having more impact.
- Concuit increases chance of getting aqua affinity, respiration, depth strider, loyalty, channeling, riptide, and impaling.
with more conduit power having more impact.
- Claimed barrels (fishermen) increase chance of getting lure, luck of the sea, and frost walker.
- Claimed blast furnaces (armourers) increase chance of getting thorns and all protections.
- Claimed cartography tables (cartographers) increase chance of getting unbreaking and feather falling.
- Claimed fletching tables (fletchers) increase chance of getting power, flame, infinity, punch, quick charge, multishot, and piercing.
- Claimed smithing tables (toolsmiths) increase chance of getting efficiency, fortune, and silk touch.
- Claimed grindstones (weaponsmiths) increase chance of getting sharpness, bane of arthropods, smite, breach, density, knockback, fire aspect, sweeping edge, and looting.
- Something bad luck related for the curses.

With these claimed job sites constellation, I'm imagining a replacement to the traditional pathfinding-isolated lectern-breaking room with an array of villagers and job blocks constellation (possibly on a piston feedtape).

To de-cheese getting all the enchantments if that's too easy, albeit repetitive, the chances could also be reduced to 0 entirely so these contellations become a necessity instead.
