# About

Just my personal notes on the Java edition of Minecraft :)  
My main goal is to understand the mechanics/how things work.  
The topics and scopes will still be limited to what interests me personally.

## Philosophy

I'll try to follow these principles with anything I put on here.

### Testable

Minecraft changes a lot over time and information can become inaccurate or no longer correct.  
This also goes for anything I put in these notes.

So everything should be verifiable on any versions it applies to,
and falsifiable at any versions beyond that.

### Reproducible

Tests should be reproducible within a reasonable effort and timeframe.  
The tools used in the test should also follow this priority list:

1. Vanilla in-game means
2. Commands
3. Datapacks
4. Mods

Everything above 4. can be bundled into a world download, so they are heavily preferred.  
Mods prompt more trusts from the user, so it should also be open-source so their content are also testable.

### Tracable to Code

Java Minecraft is not a blackbox and decompiled source code is an extremely valuable and absolute resource.  
I'll read and refer to them liberally,
but tracibility does not exempt them from testability.
