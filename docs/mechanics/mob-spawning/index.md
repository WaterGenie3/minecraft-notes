# Mob Spawning

We can categorise mob spawnings mainly into 3 types:

1. **Spawning cycle** that happens every tick
2. Spawning as part of **terrain/structure generation**
3. **Special spawning** logic

Each mobs are also categorised into different groups, each with their own limits ("cap"/"**mobcap**").
