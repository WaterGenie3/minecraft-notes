## Minecraft Source Code

Refer to Fabric guide to reading Minecraft source code [here](https://wiki.fabricmc.net/tutorial:reading_mc_code).

- The code is decompiled, so we lost all semantic information, so treat them accordingly.
- The yarn mapping is provided by the community as detailed [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn).

## Minecraft Wiki

Refer to the Minecraft wiki [here](https://minecraft.wiki/)

- The community has since moved from the Fandom wiki, so use this new one instead.
- The wiki also address a much broader audience and supports bedrock, so most coding details don't apply.
