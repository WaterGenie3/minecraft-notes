Hi :)

I'm WaterGenie3 and this is the start of my Minecraft notes.
<!-- truncate -->

I'll post updates in a more relaxed format through these blog posts.
I'm not sure where this is going yet, but I mainly want to at least understand:
  - Mob spawning algorithm
  - Pathfinding algorithm
  - Mob AI and brain system

There's also potential to automate some of the details like all the entities'
goal and target selectors, but I'll have to learn more about gradle and java for that I think.
